      Egypt contains some of the oldest, grandest sites in the world. Sure,
      everyone is familiar with the great pyramids on the Giza Plateau, but
      there is a lot more to Egypt than just the pyramids. The lesser known and
      more fun to visit pyramids in Saqqara and Dahshur are well worth the day
      trip from Cairo. You can also spend a day or two visiting the churches and
      mosques in Cairo, walking through Old Cairo, and getting a history lesson
      at the Egyptian Museum. Alexandria, with its location on the Mediterranean
      Sea, makes a nice day trip from Cairo. In Luxor, not only can you visit
      the exquisitely decorated tombs of the ancient kings and queens of Egypt,
      but there is also the enormous Karnak Temple and the Temple of Luxor. The
      West Bank contains so many tombs and temples that it takes days, yes days,
      to see all of them. It is one of the largest open air museums in the
      world.
